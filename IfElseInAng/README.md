# Angular `@if` and `@else` — Modern Control Flow (Angular 17+)

This README provides a basic overview of Angular’s modern control flow syntax using `@if` and `@else`, introduced in Angular 17 and continued in Angular 18 and 19.

## 📘 Overview

Angular’s new control flow syntax offers a cleaner and more readable way to handle conditions and loops directly in templates. It replaces traditional structural directives like `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`.

## ✅ Key Features

- `@if` replaces `*ngIf` for conditional rendering.
- `@else` is used to define the fallback block when the condition is false.
- The syntax is more readable and avoids the need for `ng-template`.

## 🔄 Compatibility

- **Angular 17:** Optional — must be enabled via a configuration.
- **Angular 18+:** Enabled by default.
- **Angular 19:** Fully supported and recommended.

## 🧠 Benefits

- Cleaner syntax with better readability.
- No need for `<ng-template>` blocks.
- Simplifies complex conditional logic in templates.

## 🛠️ Usage Notes

- Only supported in Angular 17 and above.
- Helps write more maintainable UI logic in Angular templates.
